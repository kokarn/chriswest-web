A basic webpage for the upcoming party.

# Developing
First, you need node installed.

Then just run these two commands
```sh
npm install
npm run gulp start
```

Now it should be very straightforward to view the basic page in a browser and edit what you want.
Images get copied automatically, scripts merged and styles styled.
